Allophanate
Allophanate (the conjugate base of allophanic acid; also known as urea-1-carboxylate) is created as an intermediate in the degradation of cyanuric acid to ammonia and carbon dioxide. (Esquirol et al. 2018). Within that pathway, it is a direct product of biuret acted upon by biuret amidohydrolase. (Ibid.) For many years, s-triazine was thought to be metabolized through urease, but has been demonstrated to rather have allophanate as an intermediate, upon which allophanate hydrolase acts. Ultimately this leads to the production of ammonia and carbon dioxide. (Cheng et al. 2005) Allophanate is also the product of urea carboxylase acting on urea and bicarbonate (Kanamori et al. 2005).
